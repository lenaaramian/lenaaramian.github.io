                <p><strong> How Does Venue Design Shape Retail Trading Outcomes?</strong></p>
                <p>(with Carole Comerton-Forde)</p>

                <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>: We compare execution quality across two retail trading
                    venues: one where market makers compete on price relative to a single-venue reference price, and
                    another where market makers trade at a multi-venue reference price without price improvement. Price
                    competition yields lower trading costs and executions inside the best prices. When the reference
                    prices on the two venues coincide, the venue allowing price improvement delivers lower trading
                    costs, reflecting active market maker competition. Execution losses in the venue without price
                    improvement result in Euro 1.5 million in cumulative losses per year. Fragmented pricing and the
                    absence of a consolidated tape harm retail trading outcomes.</p>

                <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>: High-frequency traders (HFTs) mainly operate on public
                    exchanges, where multiple third-party buying and selling interests interact with each other.
                    Following European regulatory changes (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II), HFT
                    single-dealer platforms have emerged on which HFTs conduct bilateral trading as dealers. We find
                    that trading on HFT dealer platforms is detrimental to liquidity on public stock exchanges. HFTs
                    manage inventory imbalances from their dealer operations by trading more aggressively and reducing
                    their liquidity supply on exchanges, which harms liquidity.</p>

                <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>: Systematic internalizers are single-dealer platforms run
                    by investment firms that trade out of their inventories by internalizing the trades off exchanges.
                    We analyze the determinants of dealers' market shares and trading costs. We find that dealer trades
                    have lower price impacts than exchange trades, consistent with uninformed traders seeking out
                    dealers. Due to their ability to avoid trading with informed investors, dealers often undercut the
                    exchange bid–ask spread when the spread is wide and the tick size is not binding. Dealers can,
                    therefore, offer lower trading costs and gain a higher market share relative to exchanges.</p>

                <p><strong> Price formation during the pre-auction phase at the close </strong></p>
                <p>(with Carole Comerton-Forde)</p>

                <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>: This paper examines price formation in the brief,
                    non-trading pre-auction phase that sets the closing auction price. Marketable orders, orders placed
                    in the final minute of the phase, and limit orders – especially new and amended ones – are the most
                    significant drivers of price formation. They move indicative auction prices toward the auction price
                    by the largest amount. Excess market orders reduce the contribution of orders to price formation.
                    Rebalance days are exceptions: market orders play a larger positive role, and overall price
                    formation effects intensify compared to regular days.</p>

                <p><strong> Anatomy of Systematic Internalizers and Price Efficiency </strong></p>

                <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3852664" target="_blank">SSRN</a>
                <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>: This study investigates the characteristics of
                    systematic internalizers and their impact on price efficiency. The results show market making firms
                    are more likely to operate as SIs. Using high-frequency measures of price efficiency, I find
                    evidence that SIs lead to more informative prices on exchanges. The improved price efficiency is
                    driven by those SIs with the highest level of market making activities on exchanges. Understanding
                    the impact of SIs on price efficiency is important, since the increased market share in off-exchange
                    trading through SIs has raised regulatory concerns about their roles in equity markets.</p>
