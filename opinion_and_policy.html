                <p class="abstract">This paper is the second in a two-paper series evaluating order book quality and
                    price formation in three
                    European markets. This paper evaluates price formation on listing exchanges and the largest
                    pan-European
                    lit venues (Aquis, Cboe, Turquoise) for main-index stocks in France, Germany, and the U.K. Using
                    BMLL
                    data, we find listing exchanges and Cboe are similarly present at the EBBO but differ in how often
                    they
                    improve it: Euronext Paris and the London Stock Exchange set new EBBO prices far more frequently
                    than
                    other venues, while in Germany, Xetra improves the EBBO less often than Aquis and Cboe. Applying
                    Hasbrouck's (1995) Information Share, Euronext and LSE contribute more to price discovery than other
                    lit
                    venues when using both trades and quotes. In Germany, Xetra leads price discovery when measured with
                    trades but lags other lit venues when measured with quotes.</p>

                <p class="abstract">This paper is the first in a two-paper series evaluating order book quality and
                    price formation in three
                    European markets. We evaluate order-book quality — liquidity and order dynamics — on listing
                    exchanges
                    and the three largest pan-European lit venues (Aquis, Cboe, Turquoise) for main-index stocks in
                    France,
                    Germany, and the U.K., using BMLL data. Liquidity varies by measure and country, but listing
                    exchanges
                    consistently show the narrowest quoted spreads and largest top-of-book depth. In France, Cboe
                    delivers
                    faster execution, lower order-to-trade ratios, and higher execution and fill rates, with no
                    significant
                    difference from Euronext in order duration. Germany shows a similar pattern, except Cboe has longer
                    order durations than Xetra. In the U.K., the London Stock Exchange outperforms other lit venues on
                    speed, order duration, and fill rates, and is statistically indistinguishable from Cboe on execution
                    rates and order-to-trade ratios.</p>

                <p class="abstract">This paper reviews the academic literature on speed bumps. This evidence shows that
                    implementing a speed
                    bump benefits the exchange instituting it - enhancing competition at the top of its order book and
                    reducing its quoted and effective spreads. However, the impact of speed bumps on overall market
                    quality
                    is less clear and remains a subject of debate.</p>

                <p>(with Carole Comerton-Forde)</p>
                <p class="abstract">This paper examines end-of-day trading mechanisms in European equity markets. It
                    shows that closing
                    mechanisms account for around 18% of consolidated Euro volume in STOXX 600 stocks from January 2021
                    to
                    September 2022. Alternative trading mechanisms that have emerged to compete with the primary market
                    auctions only capture around 16% of this activity. The paper also explores the determinants of the
                    exchange and alternative closing mechanism volumes. It also discusses the reasons behind the limited
                    adoption of alternative closing mechanisms despite offering lower trading fees. These include
                    differing
                    perspectives of market participants about the potential impact of fragmentation at the close, the
                    ability to capture the benefits of lower fees, and differences in the market structure of the
                    mechanisms.</p>

                <p>(with Carole Comerton-Forde)</p>
                <p class="abstract">European market operators offer diverse retail trading mechanisms: retail-specific
                    and all-to-all trading
                    mechanisms that allow the interaction of all trader types. This paper examines retail-specific
                    trading
                    mechanisms available in European equity markets. It documents the features of these trading
                    mechanisms
                    and the level of activity over the period from January 2019 to July 2022. It also draws on the
                    existing
                    academic literature to gain insights into the mechanisms likely to lead to the best outcomes for
                    retail
                    investors. The paper also recommends that policy makers can improve retail execution quality by
                    requiring additional transparency around retail trades and implementing a consolidated tape.</p>
